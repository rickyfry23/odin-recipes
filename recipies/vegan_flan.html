    <h2>Vegan option for a popular dessert</h2>
        <p>
            The origin of crème caramel (also known originally as flan) can be traced all the way back to the Roman Empire. Originally, this dish was called tiropatinam and it was made with eggs, milk and pepper and it was seasoned in its savoury version with fish, eel, spinach... although there was also a sweet version with honey. It was in the early Middle Ages, in Spain, when they started using only the ingredients from which the original recipe is made today, and introduced caramelised sugar into the mixture and to call it flan, which comes from the proto-germanic 'flado'.

        <p>
            In the late 20th century crème caramel was common in European restaurants. The food historian Alan Davidson speculates that this may have been because the dish could be prepared in bulk, in advance.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Caramel</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1/3 cup coconut sugar</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp sea salt</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp water</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Custard</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1/4 tsp sea salt</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp cornstarch or arrowroot starch</li>
                <li>1 tsp agar agar powder <em>(not flakes)</em></li>
                <li>1/3 cup maple syrup</li>
                <li>4 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                <li>2 (13.5-ounce) cans full-fat coconut milk</li>
            </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by getting out 4 individual ramekins; ideally they should be 3-4 inches in diameter (at the base) and 2-3 inches deep. Place them within easy reach.</li>
            <li>CARAMEL: Add the coconut sugar, salt, vanilla extract, and water to a medium saucepan and turn on medium-low heat. Set a timer for 3 minutes and stir constantly while cooking – the sugar will dissolve and the mixture should start to bubble vigorously and thicken slightly. Stick with it! If it is only gently bubbling, turn up your heat very slightly. Or if it’s smelling burnt at all, turn heat down. As soon as the 3-minute timer goes off, quickly distribute the caramel between your 4 prepared ramekins (~1 heaping tablespoon per ramekin). Set aside.</li>
            <li>CUSTARD: You can rinse the same saucepan with hot water and use it for the custard, or choose another — make sure whatever pan you choose is deep enough to hold 4 cups (950 ml) of boiling liquid.</li>
            <li>Add the salt, cornstarch or arrowroot, agar agar, maple syrup, and vanilla extract to the cooled (or room temperature) saucepan and whisk together until few lumps remain. Then add the coconut milk and whisk vigorously until well combined.</li>
            <li>Place the saucepan over high heat, whisking continuously until the mixture comes to a boil. This should take about 5-7 minutes. Then reduce the heat to medium low and set a timer for 2 minutes. Continue whisking until the timer goes off. The mixture will have thickened but should still be quite loose and pourable.</li>
            <li>Carefully distribute the custard between the ramekins, on top of the caramel. Let the flan cool for 5-10 minutes before transferring it to the refrigerator. Refrigerate for 3 hours, uncovered. If chilling for more than 3 hours, cover lightly with foil, leaving room for a bit of ventilation.</li>
            <li>Once set, you can eat your flan straight from the ramekins with a spoon, or carefully remove them by loosening the edges with a butter knife and turning them upside down onto a plate. You may need to shake gently and tap the bottom to help them slip out!</li>
            <li>Best enjoyed the first day, but will keep for up to 3 days lightly covered in the refrigerator. Not freezer friendly.</li>
        </ol>
